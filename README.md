This project will demonstrate my ability to deconstruct an existing webpage and rebuild a basic version of it. I aim to familiarize myself with the basic workflow of a developer, learn a bit more about how GitHub and Visual Studio Code work together and start utilizing the HTML and CSS bits that I've learned thus far.
